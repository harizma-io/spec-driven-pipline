  Bidirectional requirements traceability: user-spec -> tech-spec/tasks and back.
  Detects missing requirements (gaps), unauthorized additions (scope creep),
  overengineering (YAGNI, unnecessary abstractions) and underengineering
  (missing error handling, shallow architecture).

  Use when: validating tech-spec completeness, checking task coverage before implementation.
  Not for: template compliance (tech-spec-validator), code review, individual task quality.

Validate completeness of requirements coverage in a feature folder.

## Input

Orchestrator provides `feature_path` — path to feature folder (e.g., `work/my-feature`).

## Process

### 1. Discover available documents

Read `{feature_path}/user-spec.md` and `{feature_path}/tech-spec.md`.
Glob `{feature_path}/tasks/*.md` — if task files exist, include them in validation.

### 2. Extract requirements from user-spec

List every requirement, acceptance criterion, and constraint. Assign IDs: US-1, US-2, etc.

### 3. Forward traceability

**If no tasks** (tech-spec only):
- For each US-N: where is it addressed in tech-spec? Mark as covered / partial / missing.

**If tasks exist** (tech-spec + tasks):
- For each US-N: which tasks implement it? Mark as covered / partial / missing.
- For each tech-spec decision: which tasks implement it? Flag decisions with no corresponding task.

### 4. Reverse traceability

Check every element in the target documents (tech-spec decisions, task descriptions) — does it trace back to a user-spec requirement?

Elements not linked to any requirement = potential scope creep.

Acceptable without user-spec tracing: infrastructure and engineering additions (error handling, logging, migrations, tests, monitoring). Scope creep applies only to new _functionality_ not requested by the user.

### 5. Solution Depth

Solution section must contain real technical substance beyond user-spec.

- Compare Solution section with user-spec's "Что делаем" and "Как должно работать". If Solution merely paraphrases user-spec without adding technical approach, architecture decisions, or implementation strategy → finding type `shallow_solution`, severity `critical`
- Solution must mention specific technical components, patterns, or approaches. Generic solution like "We'll implement the feature using our stack" is not a solution — it's a tautology
- Architecture section must justify chosen approach. "Use React" without explaining WHY this approach and WHAT components → finding type `shallow_solution`, severity `major`

### 6. Overengineering

Check each element against current requirements from user-spec:

- **YAGNI**: components or abstractions that don't follow from current requirements? Interfaces with single implementation, factories for one object, strategies for one case → severity `major`
- **Scope creep (proportionality)**: solutions exceed what requirements demand? A one-field form with a full validation framework → severity `major`. Caching, sharding, queues without justification in requirements → severity `major`
- **Premature optimization**: performance infrastructure without evidence of load → severity `minor`
- **Layer count**: is each intermediate layer justified? Unnecessary adapters, facades, intermediaries → severity `major`
- **Task-level overengineering**: tasks in tech-spec should be brief scope descriptions. If a task contains pseudocode, step-by-step algorithms, or full implementation steps → severity `major`

### 7. Underengineering

- **Error handling**: happy path without error handling? For features handling user input, external APIs, or database operations — absence of error strategy → severity `major`
- **Input validation**: accepting data without checks? → severity `major`
- **Boundary conditions**: empty arrays, null, empty strings, overflow — not addressed? → severity `minor` for S features, `major` for M/L
- **Concurrent access**: if data is shared, is there protection? → severity `major`
- **Fragile dependencies**: hard coupling to external services without fallback? → severity `minor`
- **Shallow architecture**: everything in one file/function when task scale requires separation? → severity `major`
- **Shared resource management**: if Architecture lists multiple components using the same heavy resource (ML model, DB pool, API client) but Shared Resources subsection is empty or absent → severity `major`. If Shared Resources is filled but Implementation Tasks have no designated owner task for a listed resource → severity `major`

### 8. Structural integrity

Check that decision-level content is in the right place:
- Tech-spec Decisions section should be self-contained. If a task description contains decision-level content (architectural choices, technology picks, approach rationale) that is NOT found in the Decisions section → finding type `structural_gap`, severity `critical`. Decisions scattered across task descriptions are invisible to future readers and reviewers.

### 9. Build report

Assemble findings from steps 3-8 into the output format below. Set status based on pass/fail criteria.

Err on the side of flagging issues. A false positive that gets reviewed and dismissed is far cheaper than a false negative that produces a bad artifact. When in doubt, create a finding.

## Output

```json
{
  "status": "pass | fail",
  "sources": {
    "user_spec": true,
    "tech_spec": true,
    "tasks": true | false
  },
  "requirements_total": 12,
  "requirements_covered": 10,
  "requirements_partial": 1,
  "requirements_missing": 1,
  "findings": [
    {
      "type": "gap | partial | scope_creep | structural_gap | shallow_solution | overengineering | underengineering",
      "source": "user-spec | tech-spec",
      "requirement": "US-3: Push notifications",
      "detail": "No mechanism for push notification delivery described",
      "severity": "critical | major | minor"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "10/12 requirements covered. 1 gap, 1 partial. 1 scope creep."
}
```

### Pass/fail

- **pass** — zero findings with severity "critical"
- **fail** — at least one finding with severity "critical"

### Severity

- **critical** — missing requirement, clear scope creep (new functionality without justification), structural gap (decision-level content outside Decisions section), partial coverage where the missing parts are core to the requirement, shallow solution (tech-spec paraphrases user-spec)
- **major** — YAGNI abstraction, missing error handling for M/L features, unnecessary layers, shallow architecture, task-level overengineering
- **minor** — partial coverage of non-core aspects, scope creep that may be justified (optimization, security, infrastructure), premature optimization, boundary conditions not addressed for S features
