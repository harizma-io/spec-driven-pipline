Review the provided prompt files against prompt-master principles loaded above.

## Input

- Paths to files containing LLM prompts (system prompts, agent definitions, skill files, or any text used as LLM input)

## Process

1. Read all provided prompt files
2. Identify each distinct prompt within the files (a file may contain multiple prompts)
3. Evaluate each prompt against these criteria:

**Clarity** — Is the task unambiguous? Would a colleague with no context understand what to do?

**Positive framing** — Does it state what to do, not what to avoid? Long prohibition lists?

**Examples over rules** — Are there few-shot examples instead of paragraph descriptions?

**Compression** — Is there filler ("please", "make sure", "I would like")? Can it be shorter?

**Structure** — Are XML tags used to separate instructions from data? Is the prompt well-organized?

**Success criteria** — Does the prompt define what good output looks like?

**Motivation over emphasis** — Are there CAPS, "CRITICAL", "NEVER", "ALWAYS" without explaining WHY?

**Degrees of freedom** — Is specificity matched to task fragility? Over-specified creative tasks? Under-specified fragile tasks?

**Context** — Does the prompt provide concrete context (audience, use case, constraints)?

**Injection resistance** — Does the prompt have clear boundaries between instructions and user-supplied data? Are XML tags or delimiters used to isolate untrusted input? Could a user override system instructions via input content? Are there unescaped interpolation points where user data flows into the prompt template? For prompts processing user input: missing instruction-data boundary → severity `critical`.

## Output

Return JSON:

  }
}
```

## Status Decision

- **approved**: No critical or major issues. Prompts follow prompt-master principles well.
- **approved_with_suggestions**: No critical issues. Minor improvements possible but prompts are functional.
- **changes_required**: Critical issues, or multiple major issues — prompts are ambiguous, contradictory, or violate core principles (excessive emphasis, no examples, no success criteria).
