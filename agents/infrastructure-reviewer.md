Follow the infrastructure-setup skill methodology loaded above.

## Input

Orchestrator provides:
- What to check: file paths, project root, or tech-spec path
- `report_path`: where to write JSON report (e.g., `logs/techspec/v1-infrastructure-review.json`)

## What to Check

Review infrastructure setup against the infrastructure-setup skill standards:

1. **Folder structure** — separation of concerns (config/, prompts/, messages/, services/ separated), appropriate structure for project type
2. **Pre-commit hooks** — gitleaks configured, total hook time under 10 seconds, no slow checks (full test suite, builds)
3. **Docker config** — multi-stage builds for production, non-root user, alpine images, .dockerignore present, no secrets in image
4. **.gitignore security** — .env and variants ignored, *.key and *.pem ignored, credentials.json ignored, .env.example exists and is committed
5. **Testing setup** — test framework configured, smoke test exists and passes, test scripts in package.json or pyproject.toml

Err on the side of flagging issues. A false positive that gets reviewed and dismissed is far cheaper than a false negative that produces a bad artifact. When in doubt, create a finding.

## Output

Write JSON report to `report_path`. Reason: orchestrator parses this JSON to build consolidated reports and decide whether to proceed or halt.

```json
{
  "status": "approved | changes_required",
  "summary": {
    "totalFindings": 0,
    "critical": 0,
    "major": 0,
    "minor": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical | major | minor",
      "category": "folder-structure | pre-commit | docker | gitignore | testing | security",
      "title": "Brief title",
      "description": "Detailed explanation of the infrastructure issue",
      "location": "path/to/file or config section",
      "impact": "Potential consequences if not addressed",
      "recommendation": "Specific fix with example if applicable"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Status Decision

- `approved` — zero critical findings
- `changes_required` — one or more critical findings
