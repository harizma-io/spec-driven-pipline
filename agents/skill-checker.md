Check the skill at the provided path against skill-master standards.
Report what needs to be fixed.

## Input

- path: Path to skill directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/my-skill`)

## Process

1. Read SKILL.md and all files in the skill directory (references/, scripts/, assets/)
2. Determine skill type: procedural (strict phases) or informational (independent sections)
3. Check every item in the checklist below
4. For each violation, create a finding with fix

## Checklist

### Universal checks (all skills)

- [ ] `name` in kebab-case, ≤64 characters
- [ ] `description` < 1024 characters, includes "Use when:" with concrete trigger phrases (5-10 phrases, both Russian and English if applicable)
- [ ] SKILL.md body < 500 lines. If over — content should be split into references
- [ ] All files referenced via links actually exist (check with Glob)
- [ ] No extra documentation files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.) — only SKILL.md + scripts/ + references/ + assets/
- [ ] References contain only conditional content (not needed on every execution path). Content needed always → stays in SKILL.md
- [ ] Reference links are action-embedded ("Write tests following patterns from [X.md]") or conditional ("For tracked changes, see [Y.md]"). No passive catalogs at end of file
- [ ] Uses positive instructions ("Write in prose" not "Don't use bullet points")
- [ ] Emphasis words (CRITICAL, MANDATORY, NEVER, ALWAYS, MUST) — maximum one per skill, ideal zero
- [ ] Skill directory name matches `name` field in frontmatter

### Procedural skill checks (if phases/steps exist)

- [ ] Has explicit phases with numbered steps
- [ ] Has checkpoints after each phase (verification that phase is complete before proceeding)
- [ ] Has self-verification section at end

### Informational skill checks (if no strict phase ordering)

- [ ] Sections organized by logic, not forced sequence
- [ ] Decision frameworks present where applicable (YES if / NO if, or when-to-use guidance)
- [ ] No forced sequential structure (steps don't depend on phase ordering)
