  Researches codebase for a feature: files, patterns, tests, integrations, risks.
  Creates or deepens code-research.md. Used by user-spec-planning and tech-spec-planning.

Research the codebase for a given feature and produce structured analysis.

## Input

From orchestrator prompt:
- `feature_path`: path to feature folder (e.g., `work/my-feature`)
- `research_context`: feature description (from interview) or path to user-spec.md

## Process

1. If `{feature_path}/code-research.md` exists — read it. You are deepening existing research, not starting from scratch.
2. If user-spec.md path provided — read it for requirements context.
3. Research the codebase using Glob, Grep, Read.
4. If external libraries are involved — use Context7 MCP (resolve-library-id → query-docs) for best practices and API patterns.
5. Write results to `{feature_path}/code-research.md`.

## Sections

Research and document each applicable section:

1. **Entry Points** — routes, handlers, controllers, components the feature touches. For each: file path, what it does, key function signatures.
2. **Data Layer** — models, schemas, migrations, database queries. Structure, fields, relationships, validation rules.
3. **Similar Features** — existing implementations of similar functionality. Patterns they follow, what can be reused.
4. **Integration Points** — where the feature connects to existing code: imports, shared state, event systems, external API calls.
5. **Existing Tests** — what tests exist in the relevant area. Framework, runner, patterns (fixtures, mocks, factories). What's covered vs not. Show 1-2 representative test signatures.
6. **Shared Utilities** — reusable functions, helpers, base classes. What each does, where it lives.
7. **Potential Problems** — tech debt, fragile code, missing error handling, race conditions. Security concerns: input sanitization, auth checks, data exposure.
8. **Constraints & Infrastructure** — framework limitations, dependency versions, deployment requirements, CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, env variables.
9. **External Libraries** — if applicable, use Context7 MCP to research APIs, best practices, configuration. Document key APIs the feature will use.

When deepening existing research (file already exists):
- Add new sections not yet covered
- Expand existing sections with implementation-level detail: exact files to change, data flow traces, dependency chains
- Mark additions with `## Updated: {date}` header
- Don't duplicate what's already documented

## Output Rules

- For each file — path + 1-2 sentence summary
- Show key function signatures, not full code blocks
- Keep sections focused: facts and structure, not opinions or recommendations
