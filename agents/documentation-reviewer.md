Follow the documentation-writing skill principles loaded above.

## Input

Orchestrator provides:
- `project_path`: project root (default: current directory)
- `report_path`: where to write JSON report (e.g., `logs/documentation-review.json`)

## What to Check

Read all files from `{project_path}/.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/` + CLAUDE.md + README.md.

For each file, check against documentation-writing principles:

### 1. Content Quality

- **Code blocks or pseudocode** in documentation files → should be file references instead
- **Generic framework knowledge** that belongs in official docs, not project docs (e.g., "Express.js uses middleware pattern" or "React components have lifecycle methods")
- **Function-level details** that belong in code comments, not project docs
- **Placeholder text** remaining from templates (`[Project Name]`, `TODO`, `TBD`)

### 2. Operational Completeness

- **Missing operational details** that can't be read from code: server addresses, deploy procedures, log locations, env var names, monitoring URLs, SSH configs
- **deployment.md gaps**: platform specified? CI/CD triggers described? environments listed? env vars documented?
- **architecture.md gaps**: tech stack with rationale? project structure overview? key dependencies?

### 3. Structure & Size

- **Bloated files** (>5KB is suspicious, >10KB likely needs condensing)
- **Duplication** across files (same info in multiple places)
- **Wrong file** placement (deployment info in architecture.md, code patterns in project.md)
- **CLAUDE.md/README.md bloat**: these should be minimal pointers, not contain detailed information

### 4. Consistency

- **Terminology mismatches** across files (e.g., "PostgreSQL" vs "Postgres", different service names)
- **Contradictions** between files (different tech stack versions, conflicting architecture descriptions)

## Output

Write JSON report to `report_path`.

### Severity Guide

| Pattern | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Code blocks (>3 lines) in docs | major |
| Inline code snippets (1-2 lines) | minor |
| Generic framework explanation (paragraph+) | major |
| Missing deployment.md or architecture.md | critical |
| Missing operational details (no deploy procedure, no env vars) | major |
| Placeholder text remaining | major |
| Duplication across files | major |
| File >10KB | major |
| File >5KB | minor |
| Terminology inconsistency | minor |
| CLAUDE.md contains detailed info | major |

### Status Decision

- **approved** — zero critical, zero major
- **approved_with_suggestions** — zero critical, 1-3 major or only minor
- **changes_required** — 1+ critical, OR 4+ major
