# AI-First Development Methodology

## Overview

AI-First methodology is a structured development approach designed for entrepreneurs and small teams working with AI agents. It solves the core problem of **context loss between sessions** by implementing a distributed knowledge base and spec-driven workflow.

**Problems solved:**
1. **Context loss** - Agent forgets previous work
2. **Chaotic documentation** - Monolithic CLAUDE.md files overwhelm context window
3. **Outdated knowledge** - Agent's knowledge cutoff (January 2025)
4. **Lack of structure** - Every project organized differently
5. **Quality issues** - No systematic review
6. **Complex onboarding** - New developers get lost

**Solution:**
- **Distributed Knowledge Base** - Modular structure instead of monolith
- **Proper hierarchy** - Context → User Spec → Tech Spec → Tasks → Code
- **MCP Context7** - Real-time up-to-date documentation
- **Agent Orchestration** - Specialized subagents for different tasks
- **Quality automation** - Code review, tests, security scanning
- **Git-friendly documentation** - Versioned with code

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks about "методология" or "workflow"
- Starting new project - need workflow guidance
- Onboarding existing project - confused about approach
- Daily development - which commands to use
- Understanding system concepts and structure
- Choosing between different workflows
- Setting up project documentation

**Do NOT use when:**
- User needs infrastructure setup (use `infrastructure` skill)
- User needs testing strategy (use `testing` skill)
- User wants to create/manage commands (use `command-manager` skill)
- User asks about specific technical implementation (answer directly)

---

## Key Concepts

### Just-In-Time Context
Agent reads only necessary information for current task, not entire context.

**How it works:**
- Task development → read task.md, tech-spec.md, relevant context files
- Feature development → read all tasks, tech-spec, user-spec
- Context update → read only modified files

**Benefits:**
- Reduced context window usage
- Faster processing
- More focused responses

### Single Source of Truth
Each piece of information stored in one place, others reference it.

**Examples:**
- Project description → `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/project.md`
- Tech stack → `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/architecture.md`
- Database schema → `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/database.md`
- Deployment config → `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/deployment.md`

**Benefits:**
- No duplication
- No conflicts
- Easy updates

### Spec-Driven Development
Write specifications before code, always.

**Flow:**
1. **Context** - Project description (created once, updated) [English]
2. **User Spec** - What we want and why (for human) [Russian]
3. **Tech Spec** - How to implement technically (for agent) [English]
4. **Tasks** - Concrete tasks from Tech Spec [English]
5. **Code** - Implementation

**Benefits:**
- Clear requirements
- Approved scope
- Prevents scope creep
- Enables parallel work

### Progressive Disclosure
Information revealed gradually from general to specific.

**Levels:**
1. `project.md` - What we're building
2. `architecture.md` - What we're building with
3. `user-spec.md` - What we want in feature
4. `tech-spec.md` - How we implement feature
5. `tasks/*.md` - Concrete work items

**Benefits:**
- Cognitive load management
- Better understanding
- Easier navigation

### Agent Orchestration
Main agent coordinates specialized subagents for different tasks.

**Roles:**
- **Main agent** - Coordinates, makes decisions, plans
- **code-developer** - Implements tasks, writes code and tests
- **code-reviewer** - Reviews code quality, finds issues
- **security-auditor** - Audits against OWASP Top 10

**Skills:**
- **infrastructure** - Sets up CI/CD, Docker, testing
- **testing** - Provides testing strategy guidance
- **methodology** - This skill, provides workflow guidance

**Benefits:**
- Specialized expertise
- Parallel execution
- Quality assurance

### Git-Friendly Documentation
Documentation lives in Git with code. Reasoning in descriptions, history in Git.

**What's versioned:**
- All context files
- All specs and tasks
- All guides
- All rules

**Benefits:**
- History through `git log`
- Review through `git diff`
- Rollback through `git revert`
- Branching for experiments

## Workflow Decision Framework

### Decision Tree

**Starting new project from scratch?**
→ Use **New Project Workflow** ([guides/workflow-new-project.md](guides/workflow-new-project.md))
- Command sequence: `/init-project` → `/init-git` → `/init-project-discovery` → `/init-context` → `/setup-infrastructure`
- Result: Fully initialized project with context, git, and infrastructure

**Have existing project without documentation?**
→ Use **Onboarding Workflow** ([guides/workflow-onboarding.md](guides/workflow-onboarding.md))
- Command sequence: `/old-project` → `/old-folder-audit` → `/init-project-discovery` → `/init-context-old` → `/setup-infrastructure-old`
- Result: Legacy code preserved, new AI-First structure created

**Working on feature/bug/refactor?**
→ Use **Feature Development Workflow** ([guides/workflow-feature-dev.md](guides/workflow-feature-dev.md))
- Command sequence: `/new-feature` → `/create-tech-spec` → `/tech-spec-decompose` → `/start-task` or `/start-feature`
- Result: Feature implemented with specs, tasks, tests, and review

### Command Quick Reference

**Project Initialization:**
- `/init-project` - Copy project template to current directory
- `/init-git` - Initialize git repo and create GitHub remote
- `/init-project-discovery` - Product discovery interview → create project.md
- `/init-context` - Fill 7 context files for new project
- `/init-context-old` - Fill 7 context files from legacy code audit
- `/setup-infrastructure` - Setup framework, CI/CD, Docker, tests
- `/setup-infrastructure-old` - Setup tests only (feature branch)

**Onboarding Existing Project:**
- `/old-project` - Archive old files, initialize new structure
- `/old-folder-audit` - Analyze legacy code, create audit report

**Feature Development:**
- `/new-feature` - Interview → create User Spec
- `/create-tech-spec` - Create Tech Spec from User Spec
- `/tech-spec-decompose` - Decompose Tech Spec into atomic tasks
- `/plan-task-waves` - Decompose into parallel waves
- `/start-task` - Start single task (manual mode)
- `/start-feature` - Start feature autopilot (sequential tasks)
- `/start-feature-waves` - Start feature autopilot (parallel waves)

**Utilities:**
- `/project-context` - Load key project context files
- `/meta-context` - Load context for ~/.claude/ meta-project

## Context7 Integration

**Problem:** Agent knowledge cutoff → outdated APIs and patterns.

**Solution:** Context7 MCP server fetches up-to-date documentation.

**How it works:**
1. Agent encounters unfamiliar/recent API
2. Agent uses Context7 to fetch latest docs
3. Agent implements using current best practices

**Setup:** Mention Context7 availability in `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/references/architecture.md`:
```markdown
## Documentation Access
- Context7 MCP server available for real-time documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- Always current documentation
- Recent framework versions supported
- New API patterns learned
