# Informational Skills

Informational skills provide methodology, knowledge, or guidelines without strict execution order. The agent reads relevant sections and applies them to the current situation.

## Section Organization

Organize content by logical grouping, not by sequence. Each section should be independently useful — the agent may read any section based on what's relevant to the task.

**Common section types:**
- **Core concepts** — what the skill covers, key definitions
- **Guidelines** — rules and principles to follow
- **Decision frameworks** — when to use what (YES if / NO if tables)
- **Escalation criteria** — when to flag issues or involve the user

## Knowledge Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Methodology Skill

For skills that describe HOW to do something (analysis, review, audit):

```markdown
# Security Auditor

## Core Responsibilities
What to analyze: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication...

## Risk Assessment
How to classify findings: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## Operational Protocol
Input requirements, analysis methodology, quality assurance

## Guidelines
Principles to follow during analysis

## Escalation
When to flag immediately
```

See [security-auditor](../../security-auditor/SKILL.md) for a real example.

### Pattern 2: Decision Guide Skill

For skills that help choose between options:

```markdown
# Testing Strategy

## Overview
Test pyramid, when to use this skill

## When to Use Each Test Type
Smoke tests → purpose, use cases
Unit tests → purpose, use cases
Integration tests → purpose, use cases
E2E tests → purpose, use cases

## Decision Framework
Should I write unit tests? YES if / NO if
Should I write integration tests? YES if / NO if

## Key Principles
Best practices that apply regardless of test type
```

See [test-master](../../test-master/SKILL.md) for a real example.

### Pattern 3: Knowledge Container Skill

For skills that provide domain-specific information (company info, schemas, APIs):

```markdown
# Company Knowledge

## About
Company overview, mission, key products

## Domain Terms
Glossary of company-specific terminology

## Key Systems
Internal systems and their purposes

## Contacts
Who to ask about what
```

## Tips for Informational Skills

1. **No forced sequence** — avoid "Step 1, Step 2" structure unless steps are truly dependent
2. **Self-contained sections** — each section should make sense on its own
3. **Decision frameworks** — use "YES if / NO if" tables when the agent needs to choose
4. **Link to references** — for detailed procedures, link to separate files rather than bloating SKILL.md
