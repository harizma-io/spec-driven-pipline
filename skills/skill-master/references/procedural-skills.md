# Procedural Skills

Procedural skills guide Claude through a strict sequence of phases where order matters. This reference covers patterns specific to procedural skills.

## Explicit Steps + Phase Checkpoints

"Analyze appropriately" — bad. Claude doesn't know what specifically to do.

Break into explicit steps. For each phase — checkpoint:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Preparation
1. Read requirements file
2. Check existing tests

**Checkpoint:** Did I complete all steps? [List what was done]

## Phase 2: Implementation
1. Write code
2. Add error handling

**Checkpoint:** Did I complete all steps? [List what was done]
```

Checkpoints work because:
- Agent must verify before moving to next phase
- Creates pause points throughout, not just at end
- All phases are equal — no "attention drift"

## Self-Verification at End

Add self-check section at the end of skill:

```markdown
## Final Check

Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] Output matches expected format
- [ ] No errors in generated files
```

This is the last checkpoint — agent verifies everything was done correctly.

## Subagent Verification for Critical Operations

Self-checks work for routine verification. But for **critical operations** where mistakes are costly, add subagent verification:

**When to use:**
- Security-sensitive code (auth, user input, DB queries, APIs)
- Files that must follow strict standards (configs, schemas, contracts)
- High-impact changes (payment processing, data migrations)

**Pattern:**

```markdown
## Phase N: Verification

1. **Run Reviews** (launch in parallel)
   - `code-reviewer` — quality, architecture, patterns
   - `security-auditor` — OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities

2. **Handle Findings**
   - Agree → fix immediately
   - Disagree → discuss with user before proceeding
```

**Why subagents work better than checklists for critical checks:**
- Fresh context — no "attention drift" from long conversations
- Specialized focus — agent examines only what it's designed to check
- Structured output — JSON findings are actionable, not vague

**Include in Final Check:** If your skill uses verification subagents, add them to the self-verification checklist:

```markdown
## Final Check
- [ ] Run `code-reviewer` and address findings
- [ ] Run `security-auditor` and address findings
```

This ensures verification agents are actually invoked, not skipped.

**Creating verification agents?** Read [agents.md](agents.md) — dedicated agents, output contracts.
