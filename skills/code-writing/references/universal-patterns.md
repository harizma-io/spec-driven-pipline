# Code Patterns & Best Practices

Universal coding standards for generating high-quality code. Always applied as baseline for all projects.

---

## Naming Conventions
- **Functions/Methods**: verbs (`createUser`, `fetchData`, `validateEmail`)
- **Variables**: descriptive nouns (`userData`, `totalPrice`, `isActive`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_KEY`, `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for JS/TS, snake_case for Python
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserService`, `PaymentProcessor`)
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless universally known (`id`, `url` OK; `usr`, `calc` NOT)

## Code Organization
- **One file = one responsibility** (UserService in one file, PaymentService in another)
- **Functions should be small**: < 50 lines; if larger, break into smaller functions
- **Limit nesting**: Maximum 3 levels deep; use early returns to reduce nesting
- **Group related code**: Put imports together, constants together, functions by feature
- **Dependency direction**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level details

## Dependency Management
- **Verify imports exist before using**: Read source files to confirm exports match expected usage
- **Check function signatures**: Ensure function/method signatures match how you're calling them
- **Use Context7 for library docs**: Get up-to-date API documentation for correct usage patterns
- **Prefer well-maintained packages**: Check npm/PyPI activity, security advisories, last update date
- **Pin major versions**: Use `^` (caret) for npm to allow patch updates, avoid breaking changes

## Separation of Concerns
Extract from code into separate files:
- **Configuration**: `.env` file (API keys, URLs, timeouts, feature flags)
- **All UI text**: Never hardcode user-facing strings — extract to separate files (`messages/`, `locales/`, `constants/`) for easy updates, translations, and consistency
- **LLM/Agent text content**: Never hardcode prompts, templates, and other text content for LLMs/agents in code — extract to separate files (`prompts/`, `templates/`) for easy iteration, review, and reuse
- **Business logic**: Keep separate from framework code (routes, controllers)

## Security
- **Store all secrets in environment variables** (`.env`) — API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Validate all input**: Check types, formats, ranges before processing
- **Sanitize user data**: Before database operations, API calls, or displaying
- **Add to .gitignore**: `.env`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`, `secrets/`
- **Create .env.example**: With empty/dummy values for documentation

## Validation
- **Validate at API boundaries**: Check input in controllers, API routes, function entry points
- **Use schema validation libraries**: Zod, Yup, io-ts for runtime type checking and validation
- **Validate on BOTH frontend AND backend**: Defense in depth - never trust client-side validation alone
- **Sanitize before database operations**: Prevent SQL injection, NoSQL injection attacks
- **Fail fast with clear errors**: Return specific validation errors to help users fix input

## Error Handling
- **Use try-catch** for operations that can fail (API calls, DB operations, file I/O)
- **Log with context**: Include user_id, action, resource_id, error message, stack trace
- **Don't swallow errors**: Always re-throw after logging (unless explicitly handling)
- **Fail fast**: Validate inputs early; throw errors immediately when invalid
- **User-friendly errors**: Show generic message to users, log details internally

## Logging
- **Use structured logging format**: JSON with consistent fields for easy parsing and searching
- **Include context in every log**: userId, action, resourceId, timestamp, error message
- **Use appropriate log levels**:
  - `debug`: Development-only details (verbose, disabled in production)
  - `info`: Key operations completed (user login, order created, payment processed)
  - `warn`: Recoverable issues (retry succeeded, deprecated API used, rate limit approaching)
  - `error`: Failures requiring attention (API call failed, database error, auth failure)
- **Log errors with stack traces**: Helps debug production issues quickly

**What to log:**
- Entry/exit of key business operations (`order.created`, `payment.processed`)
- External calls (API, DB, queues) with duration: `api.call.completed { service: "stripe", duration_ms: 230 }`
- Authentication and authorization events (login, logout, permission denied, token refresh)
- State transitions (order status changes, workflow steps)
- Startup/shutdown: config loaded (without secret values), connections established, service ready

**What to exclude from logs:**
- Passwords, API keys, tokens, session IDs
- PII at info level and above: email, phone, full name, IP address (use hashed/masked versions)
- Full request/response bodies (log summary or truncated version instead)
- High-frequency events without sampling (health checks, heartbeats)

**Correlation ID**: Propagate requestId/correlationId through the entire call chain. Every log entry for the same user request should share one ID for easy tracing.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Logging inside tight loops (thousands of identical log lines)
- `console.log` / `print` in production code (use a proper logger)
- `catch (e) {}` — empty catch blocks that swallow errors silently
- Logging large objects with `JSON.stringify(entireObject)` (log relevant fields only)

## Testing
- **Test public APIs**, not internal implementation
- **Mock external services**: API calls, database, file system
- **One test = one scenario**: happy path, errors, edge cases separately
- **Descriptive test names**: `test_user_creation_fails_when_email_invalid`
- **Keep tests fast**: unit < 100ms, integration < 1s

## Performance
- **Avoid N+1 queries**: Use batch operations, eager loading, or caching instead of loops with queries
- **Cache expensive computations**: Use memoization for functions, Redis for shared state across requests
- **Be mindful of bundle size**: Check impact of new dependencies on frontend load time
- **Prevent memory leaks**: Clean up event listeners, timers, intervals, subscriptions in cleanup functions
- **Use pagination for large datasets**: Don't load all records at once, implement cursor or offset pagination
- **Profile before optimizing**: Measure actual performance bottlenecks before making changes (don't guess)

## Code Quality
- **Write meaningful comments** (in English):
  - Focus on "why" and "what for" rather than obvious "what"
  - For complex logic, "what it does" is also valuable
  - **When to write comments:** Complex business logic, non-obvious decisions, constraints, edge cases, security areas
  - **When NOT to write comments:** Obvious self-documenting code, every function, repeating type information
  - **Format:** JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs, inline comments for complex logic
  - When updating code → update comments too
- **DRY principle**: Extract repeated code into functions/modules
- **Readable > clever**: Clear code is better than short but cryptic code
- **Consistent formatting**: Use project's linter/formatter settings
- **No magic numbers**: Extract to named constants (`MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` not `5242880`)
