# Patterns & Conventions

Coding conventions, development workflow, and project-specific practices.
For universal coding standards, see `~/.claude/skills/code-writing/references/universal-patterns.md`.

## Project-Specific Code Patterns

<!--
ADD PROJECT-SPECIFIC PATTERNS HERE:

1. Framework conventions (React hooks, Django patterns, FastAPI dependencies, etc.)
2. Domain naming (Order/Cart/Product vs Purchase/Basket/Item)
3. External integration patterns (Stripe webhooks, API retry logic, etc.)
4. Database patterns (transactions, query optimization, caching)

Only add patterns SPECIFIC to this project. Don't add generic advice.
Empty section is fine for simple projects.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Production-ready code (protected). Only merge from `dev` after full testing. Triggers production deployment.
- **`dev`** - Active development. Integration branch for all work. Triggers staging deployment.
- **`feature/XXX-name`** - For complex features (optional). Created from `dev`, merged back via PR, deleted after merge.

### Branch Decision Criteria

**Direct to `dev`:** Bug fixes, single file changes, simple improvements, docs, config changes, no breaking changes.

**Feature branch:** New features, multiple files affected, breaking changes, new dependencies, external integrations, DB schema changes, architecture changes.

Rule of thumb: If unsure → use feature branch (safer).

### Testing Requirements

- **On commit:** Code changed → Unit + Integration tests. Docs only → Skip tests.
- **On merge to dev:** Unit + Integration (auto). E2E (optional).
- **On merge to main:** Unit + Integration (auto). E2E (strongly recommended).

### Security & Quality Gates

- **Pre-commit:** Gitleaks scans for secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials). Commit blocked if detected.
- **Pre-push:** Code review agent validates changes. All checks must pass.

## Testing & Verification

<!--
SCALING HINT: If this section grows beyond ~60 lines, extract to references/testing.md.
This section stores proven verification approaches discovered during development.
Generic testing methodology lives in ~/.claude/skills/test-master/.
-->

### Test Infrastructure

[How to run tests: framework, runner, test DB setup, environment requirements.]

### Agent Verification Methods

[Proven methods for agent to verify features. Updated as new methods are discovered.]

<!-- Example:
### Telegram Bot
**Method:** Telegram MCP
**Setup:** Bot must be running, test user configured
**Discovered:** 2026-01-15, during messaging feature
-->

### User Verification Methods

[Methods that require user involvement.]

<!-- Example:
### Visual UI Check
**What to check:** Layout renders correctly on mobile
**How:** Open on phone, verify responsive layout
**Why agent can't:** No visual rendering capability
-->

## Business Rules

<!--
SCALING HINT: If this section grows beyond ~60 lines, extract to references/business-rules.md.
DELETE THIS SECTION if project has no complex domain logic (simple CRUD, CLI tool, utility).

Use for: multi-step workflows, state machines, calculation formulas, domain constraints.
-->

<!-- Example:
### Order Lifecycle
pending → paid → shipped → delivered
- Cancel: only if pending or paid
- Refund: full if pending, partial if paid, none after shipped

### Pricing
final_price = (subtotal - discount) * (1 + tax_rate) + shipping
- Discount applies BEFORE tax
- Free shipping if subtotal > $50
-->
