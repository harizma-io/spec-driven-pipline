# Project Knowledge

This skill provides access to project documentation that defines how this project works, how code should be written, and how features should be developed.

## When to use

Activate this skill when you need to:
- Understand project architecture, tech stack, and data model
- Learn coding patterns, git workflow, and testing approach
- Check deployment setup, monitoring, and operational procedures
- Apply UX guidelines and design system
- Make technical decisions aligned with project standards

## Core references

All documentation is in the `references/` folder:

- **[project.md](references/project.md)** - Project overview, purpose, target audience, core features, scope boundaries
- **[architecture.md](references/architecture.md)** - Tech stack, project structure, dependencies, external integrations, data flow, data model (schema, migrations, sensitive data)
- **[patterns.md](references/patterns.md)** - Project-specific coding conventions, git workflow (branching, testing, security gates), testing & verification methods, business rules
- **[deployment.md](references/deployment.md)** - Deployment platform, environment variables, CI/CD triggers, rollback, monitoring & observability (logging, error tracking, health checks)

## Optional references

- **[ux-guidelines.md](references/ux-guidelines.md)** - Interface language, tone of voice, domain glossary, text patterns, design system (only for projects with significant UI)
- **{custom}.md** - Domain-specific files added per project (e.g., vault.md, bot.md, mcp.md)

## How to use

Read specific guides as needed for your task:

- Starting feature development - read [project.md](references/project.md), [architecture.md](references/architecture.md), [patterns.md](references/patterns.md)
- Implementing database changes - read [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) (Data Model section)
- Working on UI/UX - read [ux-guidelines.md](references/ux-guidelines.md)
- Setting up deployment - read [deployment.md](references/deployment.md)
- Creating branches or PRs - read [patterns.md](references/patterns.md) (Git Workflow section)
- Investigating logs or errors - read [deployment.md](references/deployment.md) (Monitoring section)
- Working with domain logic - read [patterns.md](references/patterns.md) (Business Rules section)

All guides are maintained as single source of truth for project knowledge.
