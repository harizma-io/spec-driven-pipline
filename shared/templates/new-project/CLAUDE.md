## How This Project Works

**Context:** All project knowledge is in `.claude/skills/project-knowledge/` skill with guides for architecture, patterns, git workflow, UX, database, and deployment.

**Default branch:** `dev`

**Library Documentation:** Always use context7 when you need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without user having to explicitly ask.
